# Types of Journal Entries

Below are the key types of journal entries used in accounting. Each plays a vital role in reflecting a company's financial health:

- **Opening Entry**: Transfers the closing balance from the previous accounting period to become the opening balance for the current period.
- **Adjusting Entry**: Corrects errors or accounts for transactions not previously recorded. These are typically made at the end of the accounting period.
- **Reversing Entry**: Made at the start of a new accounting period to reverse certain adjusting entries from the previous period.
- **Compound Entry**: Records multiple transactions involving several debits and credits. The total debits must always equal the total credits.
- **Closing Entry**: Finalizes the balances in the journal at the end of the accounting period. This balance becomes the opening entry for the next period.
